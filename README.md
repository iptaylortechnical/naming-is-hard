E.g.: /football /hockey

* Able to handle millions of current connections on a single heroku dyno
* Able to serve the average request within 2 milliseconds, from request received to response sent
* A robust public API

### Some technologies used:

* MongoDB (NoSQL)
* Web Sockets
* Angular.js
* Google Material Design for Angular
